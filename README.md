# 2020-Summer-APS360-Project

This is the Machine Learning Capstone project we completed. The task was to build a regression model that counted how many wheat heads were present in an image. The images were birds-eyeview photos of wheat grown in different regions around the world, pulled from the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) Dataset. In this project, we applied OpenCV filters to images hoping to cleanse the data for input into a CNN and an autoencoder, where we built both to compare their functionalities and accuracies amongst one another. In the end, we chose our CNN model that was able to count the number of wheat heads with a standard deviation of 4 wheat heads.
